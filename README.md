## My process
 - using vs code I set up html page
 - Then setup CSS page and added ink to head of HTML
 - added google fonts link to head of HTML
 - Add the relevant content to the body section inside an container div
 - worked on css styling using the guides

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Google fonts


### What I learned

To center container div vertically with position: absolute; & transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
Also set the with of the body to 1440px. The problem with this is I set the width of the div and when I resized the screen the over all content shrunk past the mobile width of 375px. I reset the width to min-width:375px; site is now responsive.
